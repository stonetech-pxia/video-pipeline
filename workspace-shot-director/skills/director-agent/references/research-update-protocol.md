# Research And Update Protocol

This protocol prevents the Agent from relying on stale notes or invented film knowledge.

## When To Verify Online

Use web verification when the task depends on:

- A real director, cinematographer, editor, actor, film, movement, school, textbook, interview, or historical production fact.
- A film-theory claim not already supported in `verified-director-logic.md`.
- Current AI video model/platform capability, generation limits, prompt behavior, or production workflow.
- User asks for "最新", "查证", "真实", "教材", "教科书", "大师方法", "全球导演", "不要臆想".
- The bundled references and newly verified public evidence disagree or feel incomplete.

## Source Priority

Prefer:

1. Primary sources: books, publisher pages, official interviews, director/cinematographer/editor interviews, museum/academy/BFI/Criterion/ASC/BSC resources.
2. University/film-school resources and syllabi.
3. Reputable film journals, established criticism, major trade publications.
4. Secondary explainers only as support, not as the sole basis for a claim.

Avoid using social posts, marketing pages, unsourced blogs, and AI-generated summaries as load-bearing evidence.

## Evidence Tiers

Label internally:

- **A**: primary/official/source text.
- **B**: reputable educational or institutional secondary source.
- **C**: useful but non-authoritative explanation.
- **D**: unsupported; do not use as fact.

Only A/B evidence should support claims about real directors, film history, or named methods.

## How To Use Research

Research must become a decision rule, not trivia.

Bad:

```text
Hitchcock was good at suspense, so make it suspenseful.
```

Usable:

```text
Information rule: let the audience see the danger before C1 does; keep C1's eyeline away from it for two beats; cut to C2 only after the sound cue.
```

Every researched item should be converted into:

- A director decision rule.
- A concrete action/image/sound/edit/time choice.
- A limitation or misuse warning.

## Output Citation Behavior

When research materially shapes the answer, include a compact `查证依据` section with links. Keep it short:

```markdown
## 查证依据
- Source: <link> — used for <specific rule>
- Source: <link> — used for <specific rule>
```

Do not flood the answer with citations when the user asked for a practical script or director plan. Cite only the important basis.

## Updating The Skill

Do not automatically rewrite skill files for every fact. Update the skill only when:

- The user explicitly asks to update the Agent.
- A repeated task reveals a stable new rule.
- A verified correction fixes a wrong or weak bundled rule.
- The user's personal preference should persist.

When updating:

- Add concise decision rules, not long articles.
- Keep detailed source notes in references, not the main `SKILL.md`.
- Preserve the anti-laziness contract.
- Mark user-specific preferences as user preference, not universal film law.

## User Fit Check

The Agent cannot guarantee in advance that every output matches the user's taste. It must instead use a feedback loop:

1. Produce a usable version.
2. Ask or infer what the user rejects.
3. Convert rejection into a rule.
4. Update future outputs or skill references when requested.

User correction format:

```text
用户不想要：<bad pattern>
以后必须：<replacement rule>
适用范围：<script / storyboard / director treatment / all>
```

## Research Stop Rule

Do not research forever. Stop when you have enough evidence to make the next useful decision.

If evidence remains incomplete:

- Say what is verified.
- Say what is uncertain.
- Give a conservative usable plan.
- Mark the uncertain claim `待查证`.
